# Recon

AI-powered codebase mapping with parallel subagents. Produces architecture documentation, health analysis, and actionable recommendations.

## Why Recon?

**The problem:** AI agents can't read large codebases without hitting context limits or burning tokens re-reading files every session.

**The solution:** Recon splits your codebase across parallel subagents, each analyzing a portion simultaneously. The results merge into a single persistent map.

**The payoff:**
- **Persistent map.** Agents reference the map instead of re-reading source files every session.
- **Incremental updates.** Re-runs detect changes and only re-analyze modified files.
- **Works at any scale.** 10 files or 10,000, the approach is the same.
- **Actionable output.** Not just documentation, but health signals and priorities.

One `/recon` command gives your AI agents permanent context about your codebase.

## Claude Code

**Install:**
```
/plugin marketplace add EfrainTorres/recon
/plugin install recon
```

**Use:**
```
/recon
```

Or say "recon my project" and it triggers automatically.

For a full re-scan: `/recon --force`

**Requirements:** tiktoken (auto-installed with `uv run`, or `pip install tiktoken`)

## Cursor

**Install:**
```bash
# Copy agents to your project
mkdir -p .cursor/agents
curl -o .cursor/agents/recon.md https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EfrainTorres/recon/main/cursor/agents/recon.md
curl -o .cursor/agents/recon-analyzer.md https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EfrainTorres/recon/main/cursor/agents/recon-analyzer.md

# Copy scanner
mkdir -p scripts
curl -o scripts/scan-codebase.py https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EfrainTorres/recon/main/plugins/recon/skills/recon/scripts/scan-codebase.py
chmod +x scripts/scan-codebase.py
```

**Use:**
```
/recon
```

Or say "recon my project".

**Requirements:** Cursor 2.4+, Python 3.9+, tiktoken

> ⚠️ **Known Issue:** Cursor 2.4.x/2.5 has a [bug](https://forum.cursor.com/t/subagent-invocation-not-working-anymore-on-most-recent-nightly-and-early-access-builds/149987) preventing subagent spawning. Parallel analysis won't work until Cursor releases a fix. Use Claude Code for full functionality.

## Codex

**Status:** Waiting on OpenAI

Native subagent support in Codex is [still under development](https://github.com/openai/codex/issues/2604) and hasn't been released yet. A [community PR](https://github.com/openai/codex/pull/3655) implementing multi-agent orchestration was closed in Oct 2025 as OpenAI aligns contributions with internal roadmaps.

Current workaround requires external orchestration via the [Agents SDK + MCP](https://developers.openai.com/codex/guides/agents-sdk/), which adds setup complexity that defeats the point of a simple `/recon` command.

We'll add Codex support once native subagents land. Track progress: [#2604](https://github.com/openai/codex/issues/2604)

## What it Does

Recon orchestrates multiple subagents to analyze your codebase in parallel, then synthesizes their findings into:

- **`docs/RECON_REPORT.md`** with comprehensive codebase documentation:
  - Architecture map with file purposes, dependencies, data flows
  - Entrypoints (where execution begins)
  - Config surface (all configuration files by category)
  - Environment surface and env var usage (v2.1)
  - API surface with HTTP endpoints, CLI commands (v2.1)
  - Test coverage with colocated test detection (v2.1)
  - **Dependency graph: high impact files, circular dependencies, orphan candidates (v2.2)**
  - Health summary: hotspots, staleness, duplication, complexity
  - Suggested first actions (top 5 priorities)
- Updates `CLAUDE.md` with a summary pointing to the map

## How it Works

1. **Scan:** Runs v2 scanner for file tree, token counts, git stats, entrypoints, duplicates
2. **Plan:** Splits work across subagents based on token budgets (~150k each)
3. **Analyze:** Spawns subagents in parallel with enhanced observation prompts
4. **Synthesize:** Combines subagent reports + scanner metadata into documentation

## Features (v2.2)

**Dependency Graph Intelligence (v2.2):**
- **High Impact Files:** files with 5+ dependents flagged for careful changes
- **Circular Dependencies:** import cycles detected and reported with cycle paths
- **Orphan Candidates:** unused files identified (cross-referenced with entrypoints, tests, scripts)
- Structured JSON extraction from subagents enables cross-module visibility

**Scanner Intelligence:**
- Git-powered analysis: churn hotspots, staleness detection, co-change coupling
- Entrypoint detection (package.json, pyproject.toml, Cargo.toml, Dockerfile)
- Config surface listing by category
- Exact duplicate detection via content hashing
- Generated code detection (excluded from health signals)
- TODO/FIXME counting and distribution

**Enhanced Health Observations (v2.1):**
- **Environment Surface:** all environment variables and config dependencies
- **API Surface:** HTTP endpoints, CLI commands, public exports
- **Test Coverage:** colocated test file detection
- **Dependency Flow:** import/export relationships between files
- Unused code candidates with evidence-based confidence levels
- Complexity issues with specific examples
- Inconsistency detection within modules
- "Skip if n/a" approach (no empty sections, no wasted tokens)

**Security:**
- Never outputs credential values (API keys, tokens, passwords)
- Reports key names only (e.g., "JWT_SECRET used in auth.ts")

**Actionable Output:**
- Health Summary section with prioritized findings
- Suggested First Actions (top 5 things to address)
- Knowledge risk identification (single-author critical files)

## Philosophy

> Heuristics with honesty beat precision with complexity.

- Language-agnostic: works on any language, any stack, any size
- Scanner measures, LLMs judge
- Output is curated prose, not data dumps
- Single markdown file = predictable token cost
